# Halicioglu Data Science Institute Senior Capstone

## Project Overview
This DSC Capstone Project focuses on an LLM based chatbot trained on a smart home dataset. This chatbot can answer questions pretaining to the data in the dataset. Additionally, there are guardrails built on top of the chatbot that ensure a secure user experience.

## Files Overview
This repository contains the research, experimentation, and creation of our chatbot deliverable. The main deliverable can be found in the `/app` folder. More instructions on how to run the app can be found in the next section. In the `/EDA` and   `/RAG` folders, there are Jupyter Notebooks which contain the initial exploration of our smart home dataset. We utilize the `/config` files for the guardrails and the `/text2sql` folder contains a basic implementation of the Text2SQL workflow utilized in the app. `/fine-tuning` contains the previous idea for how to train our LLM on tabular data, but we switched to a Text2SQL workflow instead. The `/persistence_layer` folder contains future work that we will incorporate into our chatbot.
