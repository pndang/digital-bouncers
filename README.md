# Halicioglu Data Science Institute Senior Capstone

## Project Overview
This DSC Capstone Project focuses on an LLM based chatbot trained on a smart home dataset. This chatbot can answer questions pretaining to the data in the dataset. Additionally, there are guardrails built on top of the chatbot that ensure a secure user experience.

## Files Overview
This repository contains the research, experimentation, and creation of our chatbot deliverable. The main deliverable can be found in the `/app` folder. More instructions on how to run the app can be found in the next section. In the `/eda` folder, there are Jupyter Notebooks which contain the initial exploration of our smart home dataset.
