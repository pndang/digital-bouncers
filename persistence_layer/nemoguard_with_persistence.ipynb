Shift energy-intensive tasks to periods with higher solar generation.\\n- **Fridge**: Regular maintenance checks and optimal temperature handling can reduce energy consumption.\\n- **Microwave**: Evaluate usage frequency and duration to identify if certain uses can be minimized.\\n\\nImplementing these strategies can help in efficiently managing energy consumption and potentially lower utility costs.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 382, 'prompt_tokens': 29937, 'total_tokens': 30319, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 27520}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_eb9dce56a8', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-2c4e3836-68e2-4809-8909-dc93923aae9a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 29937, 'output_tokens': 382, 'total_tokens': 30319, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 27520}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n",

These could have higher consumption due to operational inefficiencies or temperature setting issues.\\n- **Home Office**: If possible, try scheduling high-energy usage activities during periods of peak solar generation to offset costs.\\n- **Microwave**: Monitor usage times, reduce unnecessary long periods of operation by leveraging more efficient cooking practices.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas and monitoring the usage patterns, you could better optimize your energy usage and potentially see a reduction in your utility expenses.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 430, 'prompt_tokens': 2423, 'total_tokens': 2853, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_50cad350e4', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-7e0ba032-3209-46ca-9e84-41fb97d00456-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2423, 'output_tokens': 430, 'total_tokens': 2853, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='What did I just ask you?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='9b53b46e-107e-48b9-9ab2-fab649675db8'), AIMessage(content='You asked me to identify any sources with an increasing trend in electricity usage over time from a time-series dataset of utility usage for a smart home.

These could have higher consumption due to operational inefficiencies or temperature setting issues.\\n- **Home Office**: If possible, try scheduling high-energy usage activities during periods of peak solar generation to offset costs.\\n- **Microwave**: Monitor usage times, reduce unnecessary long periods of operation by leveraging more efficient cooking practices.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas and monitoring the usage patterns, you could better optimize your energy usage and potentially see a reduction in your utility expenses.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 430, 'prompt_tokens': 2423, 'total_tokens': 2853, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_50cad350e4', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-7e0ba032-3209-46ca-9e84-41fb97d00456-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2423, 'output_tokens': 430, 'total_tokens': 2853, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='What did I just ask you?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='9b53b46e-107e-48b9-9ab2-fab649675db8'), AIMessage(content='You asked me to identify any sources with an increasing trend in electricity usage over time from a time-series dataset of utility usage for a smart home.
